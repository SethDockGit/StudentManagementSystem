# StudentManagementSystem


A web application with a C# WebAPI controller. This application allows for the management of student and course data for an educational institution. Using Javascript and Bootstrap, the website displays student and course tables and allows the user to edit and delete related data. All requests on the front end are processed by a C# data layer which holds queries to execute against a SQL database.
